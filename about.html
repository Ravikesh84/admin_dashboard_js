        <h1>About us</h1>
        <img id="logo" src="Colorful Book Store Education Free Logo.png" alt="" height="200px">
        <p>
          Book Store is an online bookshop with a mission to financially
          support local, independent bookshops. We believe that bookshops are
          essential to a healthy culture. They are where authors can connect
          with readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked
          on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime. They are also
          anchors for our high streets and communities -- owned, staffed, run
          and full of real people who have a genuine love of books and reading. <br>
          As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an
          easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support independent
          bookshops at the same time. If you want to choose a specific bookshop
          to support, choose them from our map and they’ll receive 30% of the
          cover price (or almost all of the profit) on your orders for a year.
          <br>
          Otherwise, 10% of the cover price of your order will contribute to an
          earnings pool that will be evenly distributed among participating
          independent bookshops each month. Either way, your order is sent
          straight to your address, and all in-stock items arrive in 2-3 days.
          We also support anyone who advocates for books through our affiliate
          programme, which pays a 10% commission on every sale, and gives a
          matching 10% to independent bookshops. If you are an author, a website
          or magazine, a bookclub, an organisation that wants to recommend
          books, or even just a book-lover with an Instagram feed, you can sign
          up to be an affiliate, start your own shop, and be rewarded for your
          book recommendations. By design, we give away the vast majority of our
          profit to bookshops, publications, authors and the many others who
          make up the thriving, inspirational culture around books and reading.
          <br>
          Ultimately, we hope readers visit and enjoy independent bookshops
          whenever they can and that Bookshop.org makes it easy for readers to
          support the indies we all love, even when they can’t. Independent
          bookshops deserve a larger share of the online book-buying market. We
          hope that Bookshop.org can help strengthen the fragile ecosystem
          around bookselling and keep local bookshops an integral part of our
          culture and communities.
